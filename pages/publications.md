## Wood traits explain microbial but not termite‚Äêdriven decay in Australian tropical rainforest and savanna
*Journal of Ecology 2023, read it [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14090)*
Understanding wood decomposition is an important element of the terrestrial carbon cycle, yet there is high uncertainty in how wood breaks down in tropical environments and how this is influenced by wood traits and active decomposers. In this study, led by Drs. Stephanie Law and Habacuc Flores-Moreno, we used an exclusion experiment to understand the role of microbes and termites in the wood decay process of native tree species across a rainfall gradient. While we expected termites to greatly increase wood decay rates, we found this to be only true in the rainforest. We showed that wood traits explained a high amount of variation in microbial decay, but not termite decay. Taken together, we show how the drivers of wood decay differ between Australian tropical rainforest and savanna systems.

## Assessing the Australian termite diversity anomaly: how habitat and rainfall affect termite assemblages
*Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution 2021, read it [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.657444)*

In this paper, we assembled an international team of researchers from Australia, the UK, and the USA to better understand how termite diversity shifted over a tropical rainfall gradient in North Queensland, Australia. Led by Dr. Rebecca Clement, our study found that termite abundance in mounds and dead wood occupancy was greater at dry savanna sites compared to wet rainforest sites, and termites had greatest activity at dry sites. We observed highest termite species richness and abundance at dry sites, and low species diversity in the rainforest: we deem this the 'Australian termite diversity anomaly', and suggest this may be driven by how termites of different feeding groups colonized Australia.
