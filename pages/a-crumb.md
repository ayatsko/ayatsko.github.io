Outside of my research, I author a blog titled *a crumb*. a crumb is rooted in my curiosity and commitment to discovering sustainable harmony between society and the environment. Please check it out [here](https://acrumb.com/) for some fun and hopefully inspirational reading! Take a crumb or leave a crumb in our journey to better understand our role and opportunity to live alongside the natural world.

I hope this blog conveys the endless opportunities that we have to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. After all, like any in any learning, the path taken far outweighs the lesson learned by simply arriving at your destination.
