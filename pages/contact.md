My website layout comes on behalf of Millennial, a minimalist Jekyll theme. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog (not to mention, it's free!). You can find everything you need to get started with this theme under documentation. For more information on how to install and use this theme, check out [the documentation]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2016-10-10-getting-started %}).

This theme is completely free and open source software. You may use it however you want, as it is distributed under the [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). If you are having any problems, any questions or suggestions, feel free to [tweet at the theme creator](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=My%question%about%Millennial%is:%&amp;via=paululele), or [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/lenpaul/Millennial/issues/new).
