I am a third year PhD student with Dr. Amy Zanne at the University of Miami studying forest carbon, wood decomposition, and Australian termites. I ask questions about terrestrial carbon cycling from both tropical and temperate perspectives, and much of my fieldwork takes place in Queensland, Australia and Edgewater, Maryland, USA. I am based with the Zanne Lab in Coral Gables, Florida and work with incredible lab collaborators worldwide. 

Prior to my PhD, I earned my B.S in Environmental Science at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Distinction in Research , focusing on topics in biogeochemistry and climate change. Ithaca is not only the city of my alma mater, but it is also proudly the place that I call home. Ithaca is one of the most beautiful pockets of the world in my (obviously biased) opinion, but if you are ever in the area please reach out so I can give you prime recommendations for where to find spectacular and quaint nature.

Outside of my PhD research, I am an outdoor enthusiast, always looking to explore the best hidden hiking and swimming spots with my dog Zoe (pictured to the left). I love waterfalls, baking bread, breaking open rotten logs to look for termites, and feeling small in the presence of nature. One of my greatest passions is appreciating the immensity and beauty of nature with my friends, whether itâ€™s a sunset on the beach or an epic hike through the redwood forests. 

I am an avid runner, and at Cornell I competed as a collegiate student-athlete on the track and field team, specializing in the 400 meter hurdles. After 10+ years of competitive racing, I continue to love running, but have shifted my focus to explore more creative movements in an ever-shifting yoga practice. Since moving to Florida, I have further expanded my athletic repertoire to include playing pickleball, going bouldering, and Sunday morning disc golf, all in the company of amazing friends.
