I am captivated by tropical savanna ecosystems, and in my Ph.D. I seek to understand the savanna carbon cycle by focusing on termite-wood interactions in Queensland, Australia. Trees store carbon in their towering structures, but you don't have to only look up to find carbon. At the ground level, soils, organic matter, and deadwood also store carbon. However, as decomposers (such as termites) break down these materials, gaseous forms of carbon are released, thus moving carbon out of 'terrestrial storage' on the savanna and into that of the atmosphere.

I am interested in two largely unexplored dynamics of this carbon cycling process: specifically, wood decomposition occurring within living tree biomass and carbon fluxes released from termites. These two processes happen earlier (decomposition in live trees) and later (carbon fluxes from termites) in the carbon cycle than previous research has considered. An understanding of a) how internal tree stem damage alters aboveground carbon pools and b) the methane fluxes resulting from termite activity has implications for the overall carbon balance of the Australian savanna.

Termites are of particular interest when it comes to deadwood decomposers, especially in tropical systems. Some termites produce methane in addition to carbon dioxide as they break down organic materials, having interesting implications for global methane budgets. Like the methanogenic processes occurring in our Earth's wetlands, termites act as a natural source of methane from the land to the atmosphere. Termites can also be prominent players in internal tree stem damage, as in the Australian savanna they may target heartwood to ‘pipe’ out trees, oftentimes Eucalypts. During my PhD, I aim to more closely investigate how termites contribute to methane production and wood decomposition in Australia.

My current research projects are as follows:

*Vertical variation in internal tree stem damage in the Queensland, Australia savannas*: Trees in the Australian savannas are frequently hollowed out by termites or decayed by microbial activity. Previous estimates of this internal stem damage have quantified biomass removal using a single axis estimate of damage at DBH. I am curious to understand how internal damage scales up into the canopy, considering vertical variation. Using a resistograph drill, I measured internal stem damage at four points at increasing heights on the tree. With this data I plan to improve previous biomass reduction estimates for Australian savanna trees and re-write allometric models to accurately represent carbon storage in dry tropics ecosystems.

*TLS biomass and internal stem damage in the Iron Range*: In the bigger picture of carbon storage, forest biomass estimates are only as strong as the tools and methods used for quantification. Allometric equations have traditionally been used to estimate forest biomass, however remote sensing technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offer more accurate quantification. I carried out a destructive harvest study in the Iron Range of FNQ, Australia to both test how TLS captures biomass in comparison to regional allometries as well as trace internal stem damage from the base of trees up into the canopy. This study will help us better understand TLS as a tool for forest biomass and take a unique look into how internal damage occurs throughout the entire tree.

*Termite mound methane production and methanotrophic communities on the Australian savanna*: Termite mounds dot the dry tropics and have a noticeable presence on the savanna landscape in northern Australia. Termites are also known to produce methane via gut microbial symbioses, and I am interested in measuring the methane emissions that flux out of their mounds via their activity inside. I am exploring inter-mound flux variation and hope to scale my results to provide landscape-level termite derived methane flux estimates. I am also looking to describe if microbial communities (specifically methanotrophs) within the mound material explain methane flux variation.
