I am captivated by tropical savanna ecosystems, and in my Ph.D. I seek to understand the savanna carbon cycle by focusing on termite-wood interactions in Queensland, Australia. Trees store carbon in their towering structures, but you don't have to only look up to find carbon. At the ground level, soils, organic matter, and deadwood also store carbon. However, as decomposers (such as termites) break down these materials, gaseous forms of carbon are released, thus moving carbon out of 'terrestrial storage' on the savanna and into that of the atmosphere.

I am interested in two largely unexplored dynamics of this carbon cycling process: specifically, wood decomposition occurring within living tree biomass and carbon fluxes released from termites. These two processes happen earlier (decomposition in live trees) and later (carbon fluxes from termites) in the carbon cycle than previous research has considered. An understanding of a) how internal tree stem damage alters aboveground carbon pools and b) the methane fluxes resulting from termite activity has implications for the overall carbon balance of the Australian savanna.

Termites are of particular interest when it comes to deadwood decomposers, especially in tropical systems. Some termites produce methane in addition to carbon dioxide as they break down organic materials, having interesting implications for global methane budgets. Like the methanogenic processes occurring in our Earth's wetlands, termites act as a natural source of methane from the land to the atmosphere. Termites can also be prominent players in internal tree stem damage, as in the Australian savanna they may target heartwood to ‘pipe’ out trees, oftentimes Eucalypts. During my PhD, I aim to more closely investigate how termites contribute to methane production and wood decomposition in Australia.
