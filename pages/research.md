Forests store carbon in the towering trees that we walk amongst in the woods, but you don't have to only look up to find carbon. At the ground level, soils, accumulated organic matter, and fallen deadwood also stores carbon. However, as these materials break down in the decay process, gaseous forms of carbon are released, thus moving carbon out of 'terrestrial storage' and into that of the atmosphere. 

I am interested in the dynamics of this carbon balancing process: specifically, how does wood decay both through time and across different environmental gradients? Insects and microbes interact with deadwood decomposition, breaking down structural components in order for wood to go from freshly-fallen to spongy and indescernable from the surrounding soils. For this reason, I am also interested in characterizing decomposer communities across temporal and environmental gradients.

Termites are of particular interest when it comes to deadwood decomposers, especially in tropical systems. Some termites produce methane in addition to carbon dioxide as they break down organic materials, having interesting implications for global methane budgets. Similar to the methanogenic processes occuring in our Earth's wetlands, termites act as a natural source of methane from the land to the atmosphere. During my PhD, I aim to more closely investigate how termites contribute to methane production and wood decomposition in tropical ecosystems. 

My current research projects are as follows:

1.	*Deadwood decay through time in a mid Atlantic temperate forest*: How can we leverage long-term forest datasets to learn about the carbon stored in and cycled by deadwood? In collaboration with the Quantitative Ecology lab at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in Edgewater, Maryland, I am working to answer this question in a 16 hectare ForestGEO plot by studying the process of wood decay. Working alongside Sean McMahon and Amy Zanne, I am investigating how deadwood transitions through different ‘decay stages’ using 8 years of deadwood census data. Using this data in a predictive model will give insight as to how forest deadwood stores carbon, and what stages of decay serve as strong carbon sinks.

2.	*Carbon gas fluxes, microbial composition, and wood chemistry along the decay trajectory*: Deadwood simultaneously stores and releases carbon, but in climate models these processes are inaccurately incorporated. Qualitative measures of decay class have been used to describe wood as it breaks down, and I want to know if these classes can predict carbon gas flux. Using a greenhouse gas analyzer in the SERC ForestGEO plot, I am sampling carbon gas emissions from deadwood at different points along the decay process (spanning freshly fallen to largely deconstructed). In the future, I will sequence microbial communities and measure wood chemistry to describe the decay process further quantitatively. 

3.	*Height variation in internal tree stem damage in the Queensland, Australia savannas*: Trees in the Australian savannas are frequently hollowed out by termite or microbial activity. Previous estimates of this internal stem damage have only quantified biomass along a single axis of the tree at DBH, and I am curious to understand how this damage extends up into the canopy. Using a resistograph drill, I am measuring internal stem damage at four points at increasing heights on the tree. With this data I plan to build on previous biomass reduction estimates for Australian savanna trees and re-write allometric models to better represent dry tropics ecosystems.

4.	*Termite mound methane production and methanotrophic communities on the Australian savanna*: Termite mounds dot the dry tropics and have a noticeable presence on the savanna landscape in northern Australia. Termites are also known to produce methane via gut microbial symbioses, and I am interested in measuring the methane emissions that flux out of their mounds via their activity inside. I am exploring inter-mound flux variation and hope to scale my results to provide landscape-level termite derived methane flux estimates. I am also looking to describe if microbial communities (specifically methanotrophs) within the mound material explain methane flux variation.
