title: Outreach
---
As I continue with my PhD, I am always seeking out science communication opportunities and ways to engage people other than just scientists in my work. It is so incredibly important to make sure that scientific ideas burst out of the academic bubble that they are too often kept. I strongly believe that by dedicating time to outreach and scientific communication, we include new perspectives, consider new vantage points, and make our voices heard by all. Not to mention, it can be loads of fun!

## Science communication and infographics

In the spring of 2022 I began to learn about the magic of using infographics as a data visualization technique. In a course taught by the inspirational [Alberto Cairo](https://albertocairo.com/) in the Journalism department at the University of Miami, I have been building skills in data viz and Adobe programs to ultimately explore how infographics can communicate scientific data in distilled yet aesthetic ways. 

Check out my two main projects for the course below:

In Project 1, *Tracing the path of MANGROVE CARBON*, I illustrate how carbon cycles in a mangrove forest and how the mangrove ecosystem is a vital element in global carbon storage. Mangroves provide important habitat for organisms in the intertidal zone, protect shorelines from erosion and storm surges, and are also a key resource for storing carbon, which has relevant implications for global climate change.

In Project 2, *Wasted and Insecure: an exploration of overlaps in food waste and household food insecurity* I explore food waste within a global context, and  then narrow down to focus on food waste in the US and how food insecurity is happening simultaneously. The infographic illustrates how food waste happens at different parts of the supply chain, and how these loses depend on where in the world you are. By focusing on food waste dynamics in the US, which are largely on behalf of consumer decisions, I presented food waste challenges as a potential opportunity to address food insecurity in our country. In some sense, food waste and food insecurity are complementary problems, as they can serve as each other's solutions.

## What's your termite twin? Take the quiz to find out!

Most recently, Becca and I created a Buzzfeed quiz that determines which termite best represents your personality. We worked together with our termite reading group to make the descriptions and quiz outcomes as accurate as possible, so you are sure to find your true termite twin. Many thanks go out to members of the termite reading group, members of the Zanne lab, and Donna Davis (credit for the above photo) for their photo contributions to the quiz.

## Connecting with Cornell undergraduates on a climate change minor panel. 

At the end of April, I had an opportunity to speak to Cornell undergraduates about my experiences with the climate change minor from my time as a student, as well as how the minor lead into a climate change-focused career. It was great to speak as a recent alumni and offer advice from the academic / PhD track perspective to students interested in the intersection of climate change and earth systems reasearch.
