Termites are eusocial insects that play an integral role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in the tropics. For one of my PhD chapters, I am studying how termites in the Australian savannah cycle carbon.
For the past two weeks, I have worked with incredible Far North Queensland scientists to uncover the dynamics of methane and carbon dioxide emissions coming from termite mounds. We surveyed 67 mounds (!!), both those on the ground and up in the trees.

Working at these field sites never fails to prove to me that the life of a scientist is nothing short of a gift . I am so lucky to be in partnership with talented colleagues at James Cook University and the Australian Wildlife Conservancyâ€™s Brooklyn Sanctuary. Without help on campus, in the bush, and at Brooklyn headquarters, none of this groundbreaking research would ever be possible.

Cheers to the unending beauty of the savannah, the people and funding agencies that make my explorations possible, and of course the termites themselves; humans have a lot of vital lessons to learn from these tiny creatures.
